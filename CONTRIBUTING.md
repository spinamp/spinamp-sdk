## Contributing
The repo is still early and not hyper-polished or perfectly documented. Contributor guidelines are not ready yet, clear development docs and style/standard expectations are not extremely well documented yet. Interfaces are not well documented yet.

Keep this in mind, and if you'd like to contribute, reach out on Discord and connect with the team (https://discord.gg/cv6mza8C) so we can help guide you in contributing.
